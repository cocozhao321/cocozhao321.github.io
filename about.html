      <h2>Coco Zhao</h2>
      <p>I am Ke Zhao, and people normally called me Coco. I grew up in Wenzhou, a port and industrial city in the East coast China. I moved to Philadelphia for high school when I was 16 years old and went to Friends Select School in the center city of Philly.I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Rochester. I major in Computer Science and Cognitive Science and minor in Applied Mathematics. In my spare time, I love solving Rubick's cube, doing Sudukos and playing the piano. In addition, I am addicted to travel. Up till now, I have already been to more than 15 countries in four continents.</p>  
      <p>I started programming when I was in Elementary school by using BASIC. After I entered in high school, I learned Python, Java and web languages included HTML, CSS and Java Script. Gradually, I fell in love of computer programming and decided to major in Computer Science in the college. However, computer programming is not my only interest. After three summer internships at cognitive science lab, I became attracted by the charisma of mental processing. What factors influence people's decision making? How sleep deprivation will affect people's behavior? Why people love high-calories food? All these questions gradually raised my interst in Cognitive Science and led me to double major in BCS.</p>
